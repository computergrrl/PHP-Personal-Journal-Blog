# Project-3

Includes 4 main site pages: index.php, detail.php, edit.php and new.php.

index.php lists all the current journal entries and is sorted by date (descending).

detail.php will open the selected journal entry for viewing with and option to delete that entry located in a button at the bottom of the page.

New.php is for adding new entries to journal, and there are certain fields that I've made it mandatory to have filled out.

Edit.php is for editing/updating journal entries.

Deleting an entry is possible from either the edit.php page, or the detail.php page.  Upon clicking the delete button user should be asked to confirm that they actually want to delete so as to prevent accidental deletion of entries.

database for this project includes two tables - a 'journal' table and a 'resources' table.  This will be for future functionality and manipulation of resources data that is not available at this time (such as adding tags to pages or saving multiple web links)
